#### Features 
For this first project, I featured using a modal (a secondary, functioning window) for both the game's instructions and the final results. I also featured displaying the user's results for each question in an otherwise empty space based on their answer selection.

#### Technologies Used
This project features HTML, CSS, JavaScript with DOM manipulation.
